# FirebaseUserService
This is written in Swift. It is an API for your convenience to connect your user model with the Firebase. Besides the basic functions the Firebase provides, I have added two more functions currently. One is handleError which will return customized errors message and save undefined errors' info. on the database. The other one is activateCurrentUser which will reload firebase current user, set up the login log observer, and fetch current user data. The observer is for current user to detect multi-logins simultaneously. If you don't need the observer, you can use the function activateCurrentUserWithoutObserver instead.
